## The paper

We reviewed Resplandy et al 2018 - Quantification of ocean heat uptake from changes in atmospheric O2 and CO2 composition - Nature 563, pages105–108 (2018) 

DOI https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0651-8

They propose a new method* to assess ocean warming, based on atmospheric calculations of CO2 and O2 rather than hydrological/ocean temperature data

## Where did we find the data

1. They use __APO__, O2, CO2 data from __Scripps O2 program__ http://scrippso2.ucsd.edu/apo-data. 

2. They also use other databases with hydrological measurements, such as the __GLODAPv2__ data:

doi: 10.5194/essd-8-297-2016    

3. They link code from four earth system models

## FAIRness assessment

### APO, CO2, O2 data

### Findable

- [X] A persistent identifier is assigned to your data      
- [X] There are rich metadata, describing your data
- [X] The metadata are online in a searchable resource e.g. a catalogue or data repository
- [-] The metadata record specifies the persistent identifier

### Accessible

- [X] Following the persistent ID will take you to the data or associated metadata
- [X] The protocol by which data can be retrieved follows recognised standards 
- [X] The access procedure includes authentication and authorisation steps, if necessary
- [X] Metadata are accessible, wherever possible, even if the data aren’t

---

### Interoperable

- [X] Data is provided in commonly understood and preferably open formats
- [?] The metadata provided follows relevant standards
- [X] Controlled vocabularies, keywords, thesauri or ontologies are used where possible
- [?] Qualified references and links are provided to other related data

### Reusable

- [X] The data are accurate and well described with many relevant attributes
- [-] The data have a clear and accessible data usage license
- [X] It is clear how, why and by whom the data have been created and processed
- [?] The data and metadata meet relevant domain standards.

We downloaded the monthly data for APO and CO2 and summarized it to obtain mean values per year. We compared the values with the data from fig 3.
